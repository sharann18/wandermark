# WanderMark
WanderMark is a simple project made using Leaflet.js that lets you log and organize places you've been, want to visit, and plan trips. With a user account, you can drop pins, add descriptions, and rate your experiences at different locations. The project utilizes the MERN stack, incorporating React for the front end, Express in the backend, and MongoDB for storing data. It has been deployed on Vercel.
